# FAQ
Q: After I loaded my script and clicked execute it takes forever?
A: The first time you load a script it will take a while because it needs to copy the byfron signature and verify it. Every time after this, scripts ill load ver quickly/instantly.

Q: When I loaded my script and clicked execute, after some time, it said anti-virus interfered with the injection?
A: Anti-virus can interfere with the injection process the first time you load a script because it is hijacking byfron anti-cheat's signature by side-loading into Roblox client, which anti-virus flags as malicious/suspicious. This is a false positive, you can disable anti-virus for firs time injection and then re-enable it later if it is causing issues.
